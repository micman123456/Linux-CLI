Linux-CLI - Ali Fadhil B00837578 al878898@dal.ca

Hello! This is a simple CLI I made for Linux. I made this for a project in
University, so it's quite primative and it can only accept built in Unix commands. 
However it is fully functional and it even has a histroy feature. Feel free 
to download it and use it or make improvements to it. 

How to compile:
gcc -o Linux-CLI Linux-CLI.c

Available Commands:
1. Most built in Unix commands - cal, ls, top etc...
2. history - Display command history and PID
3. !! - Execute most recent command
4. !N - Execute command with id N
5. exit, quit or q - Exit the application
6. help - brings up this help screen
